abstract: Modeling atmospheric turbulence is a challenging problem since the light rays arbitrarily bend before entering the camera. Such models are critical to extend computer vision solutions developed in the laboratory to real-world use cases. Simulating atmospheric turbulence by using statistical models or by computer graphics is often computationally expensive. To overcome this problem, we train a generative adversarial network which outputs an atmospheric turbulent image by utilizing less computational resources than traditional methods. We propose a novel loss function to efficiently learn the atmospheric turbulence at the finer level. Experiments show that by using the proposed loss function, our network outperforms the existing state-of-the-art image to image translation network in turbulent image generation. We also perform extensive ablation studies on the loss function to demonstrate the improvement in the perceptual quality of turbulent images.
