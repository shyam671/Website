abstract: The IIIT-CFW is database for the cartoon faces in the wild. It is harvested from Google image search. Query words such as Obama + cartoon, Modi + cartoon, and so on were used to collect cartoon images of 100 public figures. The dataset contains 8928 annotated cartoon faces of famous personalities of the world with varying profession. Additionally, we also provide 1000 real faces of the public figure to study cross modal retrieval tasks, such as, Photo2Cartoon retrieval. The IIIT-CFW can be used for the study spectrum of problems as discussed in our paper.
