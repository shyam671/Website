Hi!! I am Shyam Nandan Rai, currently pursuing my masters at CVIT, IIITH. I work under the joint supervision of [Prof. C.V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/index.html), [Prof. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/), and [Dr. Anbumani Subramanian](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/bios/anbumani-subramanian.html) on the problems of image restoration in adverse weather conditions. My current research interest specifically lies in GANs, Semantic Segmentation, and problems related to the imbalance in large-scale datasets. Previously, I was an undergrad honors student at IIIT, Sricity where I worked on the problems related to Cartoon Image Understanding in collaboration with Prof C.V. Jawahar and [Prof. Anand Mishra](https://anandmishra22.github.io/).
