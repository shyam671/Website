CiaoðŸ‘‹!! I am a first-year ELLIS doctoral student in the VANDAL lab at Politecnico di Torino, Italy, under the supervision of Prof. Barbara Caputo and co-supervision of Prof. Zeynep Akata. My current areas of interest lie in the amalgamation of semantic segmentation, open-world detection, and federated learning. 

I completed my master at IIIT Hyderabad, where I was under the joint supervision of Prof. C.V. Jawahar, Prof. Vineeth N Balasubramanian, and Dr. Anbumani Subramanian on the problems of image restoration in adverse weather conditions. Previously, I was an undergrad honors student at IIIT, Sricity, where I worked on the problems related to Cartoon Image Understanding in collaboration with Prof C.V. Jawahar and Prof. Anand Mishra.
